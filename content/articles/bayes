:description: This article introduces the notion of Naive Baye's classifier,
 using a simple example.
 
Let's say we have a bunch of fruits in a basket, and the task is to write
an algorithm to classify them into an *apple* or a *banana*. How would one logically
tackle this task? A natural way is to describe a set of features for *apple* and 
*banana*, and check if the fruits in the basket match those features. This problem
is what is called as a *classification* problem in the field of *Machine Learning*.

Let us say the features that are of interest are, the *color* and *shape*.
