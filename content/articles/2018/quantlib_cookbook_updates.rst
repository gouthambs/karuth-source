:description: Updates on the QuantLib Python Cookbook

More than a year ago, Luigi Ballabio and I made an initial release of the QuantLib Python Cookbook. Now we are mostly
finished with the content of the book. The `new version of the book <https://leanpub.com/quantlibpythoncookbook>`_ is
out, and those who bought a previous version can now log into LeanPub to download the new version of the book and the 
accompanying python code in the form of notebooks.

This version includes some content update and preliminary support for Python 3. We are working to convert 
IPython notebooks into Jupyter notebooks and that will be the next release milestone for the book. You 
should expect to hear from us in about a month or so.
