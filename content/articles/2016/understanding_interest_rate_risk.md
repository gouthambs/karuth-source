Description: Gives an introductory understanding of why different business units care about interest rate risk and how they can address it.


Interest rate changes affect returns on bonds and other fixed income assets, in which 
a lot of people nearing retirement would have their money invested. But volatility in 
interest rates also affect non-investment businesses which then indirectly affect the prices
that we pay for products that we consume.

There are different businesses units that care about interest rate risk. Some businesses
hurt when rates go down, while others care if the rates go up. The fact that different 
businesses have different concerns on interest rate movements mean that hedging strategies 
can be employed. In some sense, hedging is a way of distributing risk from one entity to 
others. When all is well, this can be a great thing for your business. The concept or 
interest rate risk management involves understanding, quantifying and hedging interest rate risk. 

## Who cares about interest rate risk?

There are different industries and businesses that are affected by interest rate fluctuations. Let
us look at a few examples.

- **Fixed Income Investors**: Funds that we contribute to our retirement accounts or pension plans are 
  invested in equity and fixed income funds. Fixed income investors purchase bonds which are 
  affected by interest rate fluctuations. Price of a fixed income bond is (generally) inversely 
  propotional to interest rate movements, i.e. the value of the investment drops when interest rates
  rise and gains when interest rates drop. The sensitivity of fixed income investment to interest rate
  depends on the asset's maturity. Longer maturity investments are more sensitive to interest rate 
  changes than short maturity investments.
  
- **Mortgage Lenders & Servicers**: Mortgage lenders allow prospective home buyers to lock in on a 
  mortgage rate for a couple of months. Lets say, that the lender has provided the home buyer a locked
  mortgage rate for a loan of \$100,000. But in 2 months time, when the home buyer closes on the loan,
  should the interest rates rise, then mortgage loan is worth less than \$100,000 and the lender stands
  to lose when he sells in the secondary market. Similarly, on the mortgage servicing side, when interest
  rates go down, the loans in the servicing portfolio could drop out due to interest rate refinancing. This
  can lead to decrease in projected cashflows.
  
- **Small and Large Businesses**: Businesses need to raise capital in order to expand, and very often
  do so by using loans from financial institutions. The loans given out to small to medium businesses
  typically carry floating rate payments. Because of a variable interest rate loan, businesses are exposed
  to the interest rate fluctuations. 
  

## Addressing Interest Rate Risk

There are various tools available to market practitioners to mitigate exposure to interest rate risks.
Derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps allow two parties to exchange cashflows such as 
fixed to float, or float on one tenor with float on another tenor. By entering a fixed for float swap,
businesses can convert a floating payment on their loans into a net fixed payment.

Futures contracts on interest rate with different maturities on the deliverable allows one to hedge
interest rate risk exposure on their books. The Futures contracts are exchange traded and offer 
liquidity and do not have credit risk associated.

In this blog post, I provided an introduction to interest rate risk and how it can be managed. At a later
post, I will drill into some of the specifics of how certain derivatives can help hedge interest rate risk.
