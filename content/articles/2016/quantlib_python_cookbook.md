Hello everybody! [Luigi Ballabio](http://www.implementingquantlib.com/) and I have published "QuantLib Python Cookbook" 
on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/quantlibpythoncookbook). This book is a collection of 
[Luigi's youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu_PrO8j6XAvOAlZND9WUPwTHY_GYhJVr) and 
my blog posts [tutorials on QuantLib python](http://gouthamanbalaraman.com/blog/quantlib-python-tutorials-with-examples.html).

This book gives an introduction to various QuantLib concepts such as interest rate curve construction, calibration and
simulation of interest and equity models, and finally valuation of bonds and equities. This book is meant to be a resource for the 
QuantLib community at large.
