| On this day, we mourn the loss of Jayam
| Mother to our dads,
| Grandmother to us,
| Great grandmother to our offspring
| And an affectionate human being to all
|
| May we also remember the spirit that represents the person she was
| And what she has left in us - in our little genes and in  our memories.
|
| Lets us remember how her partial blindness 
| Did not impede her ability to fulfil her parental duties.
|
| Let us remember her love for music 
| And how she strived to impart the same in us.
|
| Let us remember that in her own quiet ways -
| Folding clothes in a corner,
| Sipping *Narasus* coffee,
| Telling bedtime stories, 
| She made a resonant impact in all our lives.
|
|
| Perhaps this is the day for us to pause from all the rigmarole 
| And *remember* what it means to be *remembered*.
|
| Perhaps this is the day for us to believe 
| That in the face of *impossibilities* it is *possible* to carry on.
|
| Perhaps this day should be a reminder for us 
| To *live* the gift that is the joy of *living*.
|
| May her soul rest in peace!
