# Conclusion

This post shows how convergence of Monte Carlo simulations of Hull-White short rate model is dependent
on the ratio $\sigma /a$. You can download the [ipython notebook on convergence of Monte Carlo simulations of
Hull-White model](/extra/notebooks/hull_white_monte_carlo_convergence.ipynb).
