    gives us a view of understanding market sentiment historically.

In the last couple of decades, the US market has witnessed a
technology bubble, a housing bubble, recession, and market
crashes. I wanted to understand the human sentiment, the fear
when market crashes, the euphoria while riding the upside of the bubble.
Here I narrate the story of wall-street from the view of short-term volatility.

Volatility
----------

Volatility is a finance jargon for quantifying uncertainty over a window of time. 
If the window is small (like a week),
then one can get a view of the market's reaction to day-to-day occurrences. On the other hand
if we measure volatility using a larger window (such as a year), then a lot of the day-to-day
noise dies out, and you get a macroscopic view of the market.

I wanted to understand how the market reacts to the crashes, and recessions.
Do these things just happen out of the blue? Is there a lot of uncertainty, fear or excitement
leading up to a market collapse? Is there a way to compare the latest market crash with those that
have come before?

The Voice of Uncertainty

The picture above shows the S&P 500 index at the top, and its short-term 
volatility over the last 33 years. The last 33 years have gone through 
4 recessions, the regions shaded in green. Here are some interesting
observations:

- The markets prior to 1995 were less volatile, by about 24%, than 
  post 1995. The average volatility was 14% for the time period of 
  1980 to 1995, in contrast with a 17.3% for the period 1995 to 2013. 

- On pure percentage terms, the market crash on Black Monday (S&P 500 fell by 25.7% on Oct 19, 1987) 
  was larger than the market drop in 2008 (21% drop in the week ending October 10, 2008). 
  But the volatility paints a totally different picture. The uncertainty during 
  2008 market crash was roughly 20% more than that during the 1987 market crash.

- In August of 2011, the S&P downgraded US credit from AAA to AA+. This made 
  the market volatile, and that is the little blip you see in 2011. The irony is,
  prior to 2008 crash, S&P had rated a some of the mortgage backed securities as 
  high quality debt, even though a lot of them defaulted.
 
Methodology
===========

I use S&P 500 to be representative of the stock market. The short term volatility is 
calculated by computing volatility using daily returns over a 45 day window.
