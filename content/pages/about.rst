This site explores a computational and scientific approach to understanding
and addressing problems in finance, computation, and life.

I am Gouthaman Balaraman, and I work as a Quant in a Financial Services Firm. 
I have a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics and my interests are in quantitative 
finance, high-performance computing, and economics.

Some of the projects that I am involved are:

1. `UCarpool <https://ucarpool.org>`_ is a Los Angeles community of people who are looking to carpool to work.
2. `Flask-Blogging <https://github.com/gouthambs/Flask-Blogging>`_ is a Flask extension for adding a blog to your site.
